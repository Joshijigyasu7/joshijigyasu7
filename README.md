## ⚡ Fun Fact

My name’s **Jigyasu** — which literally means **curious**, and yes, I live up to it!  
But here's the twist: I’m also a **shy and introverted** soul.  
Sometimes that holds me back, and it feels like it hinders my success.  
But I'm learning to embrace it — because even in silence, something powerful is always cooking. 🚀
